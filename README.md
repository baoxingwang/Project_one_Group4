Project Title: Eclipses Duration in Mars

A)	Team members: 
o	Mahathi
o	Baoxing
o	Luis


B)	Project description:
Using public data (mainly but not exclusively) from “ESA's Mars Express Operations Dataset”, the Team 4 will attempt to “shed light” on the impact that Mars distance from the Sun and Mars distance from the Earth has in Mars eclipse duration.

C)	Research questions to answers:
1.- Are the eclipse duration in Mars a function of Mars distance in kilometers from sun?
2.- How does it changes (eclipses duration)?
3.- Is there a noticeable pattern in the Eclipses duration when comparing three different martial years.
4.- Does the distance from Mars to Earth matter in the eclipses duration?

D)	Data set to be used:
Data composed of context and electric current measurements data for the following four Martian years:
•	Year 1: 2008-08-22 to 2010-07-10
•	Year 2: 2010-07-10 to 2012-05-27
•	Year 3: 2012-05-27 to 2014-04-14
•	Year 4: 2014-04-14 to 2016-03-01
A Martian year is defined by 687 earth days. 
Note that space communication issues may have introduced gaps in the given data.
Files are all in CSV format.

E)	Rough breakdown of tasks:
-	Import CSV files
-	Merge data
-	Clean data
-	Create dataframes
-	Group by.
-	Create final data set.
-	Extract key data for plotting
-	Build Plots
-	Write observations and conclusions
